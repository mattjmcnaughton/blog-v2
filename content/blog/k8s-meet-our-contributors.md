Just a quick post :)
Yesterday, I had the pleasure of being a guest on the Kubernetes projects'
awesome monthly [Meet Our Contributors](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/07/10/meet-our-contributors-monthly-streaming-youtube-mentoring-series/)
session, led by [Paris Pittman](https://github.com/parispittman).
[Nikhita Raghunath](https://github.com/nikhita) and [Paul
Morie](https://github.com/pmorie) were also guests; it was great to speak
with, and learn from, them.

Here's the recording of the session!

These sessions happen every month and are a great resource. A big thanks to Paris for
organizing them, and would definitely encourage everyone to check them out and
ask questions. See the #meet-our-contributors channel on the k8s slack for more
info!
