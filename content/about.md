Hi, my name's Matt :) I live in New Jersey (after 10 years in NYC) and am the proud parent of two pugs, Cosmo and Stuart!

As of December 2025, I'm working to re-engineer Clinical Research for impact as a Principal Software Engineer at [Paradigm Health](https://www.paradigmhealth.io/). Previously, I worked at [Flatiron Health](https://flatiron.com/) from 2016-2025.

For the last couple of years, at both Paradigm Health and Flatiron Health, I've focused on emerging AI technologies and clinical research. In my early days at Flatiron, I focused on DevOps/DevEx solutions within our Real World Evidence business.

From 2018-2020, I focused most of my "leisure" coding time on Kubernetes and the Cloud Native ecosystem. I contributed code and reviews to Kubernetes and its associated projects as much as possible, and was tremendously excited and grateful to have served as a [Reviewer for sig-node](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/OWNERS). My biggest project was writing and implementing a [KEP for Building Kubelet Without Docker](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/560). Though I'm no longer working on Kubernetes every day, I still watch the project with interest, and contribute when I can.

To be honest, as of 2025, I'm not the most prolific of bloggers, but will post when I have something I'd like to share :)

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/mattjmcnaughton), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mattjmcnaughton), or reach me through [email](mailto:me@mattjmcnaughton.com). You can find my [GPG public key here](/artifacts/gpg/mattjmcnaughton.pub.asc) and I'm happy to share a copy of my resume upon request. Just drop me an email!
